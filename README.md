# Crypto Things

This is the place to get sad that you didn't make that crypto investment you believed in so much, or relieved that you didn't.
Select a cryptocurrency, and check what would have happened if you invested in it in a specific range of time.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Why Crypto Things exists?

NextJS released App Router, and I needed a project to test it. I also wanted to learn more about the crypto world, so I decided to create this project.
